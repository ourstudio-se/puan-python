Puan documentation
==================

**Version:** |version|

   Puan is an open source toolkit for modelling combinatorial optimization problems on a higher level. Combinatorial optimization problems are in general hard and require a lot of time and effort to
   solve, even for a computer. But not only are they hard to solve they are also often hard to define and model. Puan aims to ease the work by offering easy-to-use tools for modelling and advanced algorithms
   to generate efficient models for optimization.
