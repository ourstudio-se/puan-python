Puan documentation
==================
Puan is an open source toolkit for modelling combinatorial optimization problems on a higher level. Combinatorial optimization problems are in general hard and require a lot of both time and effort to
solve, even for a computer. But not only are they hard to solve they are also hard to define and model. Puan aims to ease the work for problem modelling such that it can
be worked on for a period of time and to optimize computation complexity for reducing into a linear programming problem.
